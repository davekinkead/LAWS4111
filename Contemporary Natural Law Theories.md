# Contemporary Natural Law Theories

## Lon L Fuller

> Forgetting purposes is the commonest form of stupidity

> Law is the enterprise of subjecting human conduct to the governance of rules.

Fuller's Primary Argument

1.  Rules help ensure social harmony.
2.  Social harmony enables individuals to realise their goals.
3.  Laws are rules whose purpose is to realise social harmony.
4.  Any law that fails in it's purpose cannot be truly called a law.

    Can the debate between legal positivists and natural law theorists be summarised as procedural vs functional definitions?

### Moralities of the Law

Fuller lists eight requirements of the internal morality of the law:
    
- generality, 
- promulgation, 
- prospectivity, 
- clarity, 
- consistency, 
- observability, 
- constancy, and
- congruence.    

Fuller distinguishes between the internal and external morality of the law.  The internal morality (above) describes the requirements of the rule of law, and thus of legal validity.  External morality reflects the law's requirement to be not to be incongruent with some external moral principle.

He also distinguishes between moralities of duty and aspiration.  Moralities of duties outline the minimal standards of permissive behaviour. Violating these attracts criticism but adhearnce doesn't attract praise.  Moralities of aspiration by contrast, outline higher, supererogatory human ideals.  Achieving them attracts praise but failure doesn't attract criticism.

Internal validity, as defined by the 8 principles, is what determines legal validity.  Laws that conflict with external morality but comply with internal morality are still laws.

    How does efficacy affect accounts of law?  Can positivists endorse law that is not followed or not effective?

Internal morality -> morality of aspiration -> supererogative duties

External morality -> morality of duty -> obligatory duties

## John Finnis

Finnis starts with an account of objective moral realism justified by self evident basic and pre-moral values which are indemonstrable and underived.  They cannot be reasonably denied.

He was a value pluralist who held that the basic human goods are incommensurable and encompassed:

- life
- knowledge
- recreation
- aesthetic experience
- friendship
- spirituality
- practical reasonableness

### Practical Reasoning

We are often faced with choices.  The choices we make are choices of prioritising values.  Being practical means making choices that best reflect the values we want to realise.  Making choices that don't respect or conflict with our values is acting unreasonably.

In this way, there may be more than one correct moral choice.

Finnis outlines nine requirements of practical reason:

- a coherent plan of life
- no arbitrary discounting or exaggeration between values
- no arbitrary preferences among persons
- detachment
- commitment
- efficiency within reason
- respect for every basic value in every act
- having regard to the common good
- following oneâ€™s conscience.

### Defining Law

One possible approach to defining law would be to catalog all laws in legal systems in history and identify common features they shared.  This would be a very minimal set of common attributes.

Another approach would be to identify the clearest & most obvious cases. This would be the central case of laws.

But which features one selects as paradigmatic is dependent on one's perspective. 


He eventually defines law as

- set of rules made by an effective and determinate authority in accordance with rules of recognition.
- directed to pursue the common good of the community.
