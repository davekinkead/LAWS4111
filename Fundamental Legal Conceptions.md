# Fundamental Legal Conceptions

### Fundamental Legal Conceptions of W.N. Hohfeld

The law is action guiding and informs people of what they may and may not, must and must not do.  It does this by creating legal rights and duties.

Rights are correlatives of duties.  Having a right to x means that others have duties not to prevent x.  In any legal relation, the presence of one entails the presence of the other

Hohfeld added finer distinctions to the idea of legal rights and duties.  He argued that a right could mean:

- A _claim_ or right in the strict sense.  A right to be paid as per a contract.
- A _liberty_ or privilege. A right to smoke in my own house.
- A _power_. A right to bequeath my estate.
- An _immunity_. A right not to be searched without a warrant.

And these rights have correlatives:

- Right <--> Duty
- Liberty <--> No right
- Power <--> Liability
- Immunity <--> Disability

Correlatives `|` - In any legal relation between two parties concerning a single act or omission, the presence of one conception in one party entails the presence of the correlative in the other party.

Opposites `\ & /` - In any legal relation between two parties concerning a single act or omission, the presence of one conception in one party means the absence of the jural opposite in that party

Contradictories `---` - In any legal relation between two parties concerning a single act or omission, the presence of one conception in one party means the absence of the contradictory in the other party.

In a two party relation:

- _Power_ is the _liberty_ to impose a _duty_ or confer a _liberty_.
- _Liability_ is the _no-right_ that a _duty_ not be imposed or a _liberty_ not be conferred.
- _Immunity_ is the _right_ that a _duty_ not be imposed or a _liberty_ not be conferred.
- _Disability_ is the _duty_ not to impose a duty or confer a _liberty_.


### Commentary

These squares offer vague distinctions that are not mutually exclusive.  Consider:

> The right of the referee to send off (remove from the game) a football player for foul play. 
    
The power is correlative to a football player being liable to the referee removing a football player from the game for foul play.  But the player also has a duty to obey the referee therefore the referee has a correlative claim right.

A better conception is to view legal relations as static or dynamic, present or absent.  Claims & obligations are correlatives of static present relations.  Liberty & No-Rights are correlatives of static non-existing relations - I'm free to x because I am in any legal relation to not x.

Power and liability are correlatives of dynamic actual relationships.  I have the power to X if I have the ability to change the legal relation concerning x.  Immunity and No-Power are correlatives concerning the inability to create new relations.  I am immune from x if you have no power to impose x.
