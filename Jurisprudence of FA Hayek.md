# The Jurisprudence of F.A. Hayek

## Epistemology 

Hayek's theory of jurisprudence is largely a factor of his epistemological theory. Tradition accounts of jurisprudence were developed from the perspective of what Hayek called _Constructivist Rationalism_, a doctrine that held knowledge could be derived from logical principles.  Whist the empiricists had clearly rejected this form of rationalism, Hayek thought that legal positivists in their tradition assumed too much was possible from their knowledge.  The complexities of human systems meant that no single person or group could know sufficiently much to proscribe adequate laws.

Hayek's second critical perspective was against the rationalist belief abstract notions were a product of conscious thought.  Rather he claimed that particulars informed the abstract and that the abstract conception is what made thought possible.  For Hayek, the mind was simply the product of neuro-sensory input intersecting with the environment.

Hayek's final observation was that physical and social systems exhibit emergent properties.  While it may be possible to know of all the rules that guide the system, it is impossible to ever know the multitude of preferences, wants, intentions, and beliefs of individual agents.

_Critical Rationalism_ by contrast, accepts the inherent limitations on human knowledge which is itself simply the accumulation of rules and practices.  Rationalists, Hayek claimed, suffered from a _synoptic delusion_.
 
## Order

The Greeks divided the world into a trichotomy of phenomena.

- Thesei (the artificial)
- Nomio (the customary)
- Physei (the natural)

Of these, it was the first two that Hayek was concerned with in his legal-political study.  He described order that was a result of human intention as _taxis_ or organisational order.  This he contrasted with _cosmos_ or spontaneous order.  

Taxis is characterised by:

- Deliberately designed (there is a creator)
- Purpose known to creator
- Suited for the head who commands necessary knowledge

Cosmos however:

- Arises endogenously
- Is end-independent and without intentional purpose
- Provides order but leaves individual elements scope to pursue their own ends
- Knowledge is dispersed among the elements

Hayek thought that positivism conflated all legal and social order as taxis, the product of intentional design.  The common law however, exhibited much different, spontaneous characteristics. 

To these two types of orders, Hayek posited two types of rules.

-   Thesei (rules of an organisation)
    Intended to achieve specific ends
    Substitute for specific commands 

-   Nomoi (rules of a spontaneous order)
    End independent rules 
    Abstract and impersonal
    Results from the coincidence of behaviour among members pursuing different ends
    No guarantee of specific outcomes
    They exist because people who observed them were successful

## Laws

Extending his dichotomies, Hayek described two types of laws.  Private laws are:

- Rules of just conduct enforced by courts
- Abstract, impersonal and end-independent
- Arose spontaneously though they have been codified in some societies
- Typically phrased in the negative

Public law however is:

- The law of government
- Directed at agencies
- Predated by private law

The role of the judge according to Hayek was maintain the evolving common law by interpreting standing social order and expectations.  They must decide...

>   ..not whether the parties have obeyed anybodyâ€™s will, but whether their actions have conformed to expectations which other parties have reasonably formed because they correspond to the practices on which everyday conduct of the members of the group was based. 
>
>  --   LLL vol 1, 96

Occasionally however, judges face hard cases whenever existing order conflicts with changing circumstances.  Either a new situation arises where the established rule does not apply, in which case the judge distills new rule from inchoate principles established in earlier case.

Alternatively, two or more established rules create conflicting expectations.  Here, the judge is to reconcile the rules, if necessary, by delimiting one or both of them.

The proper use of legislation for Hayek then, is limited to

- Correct common law when it is miscarried
- Rapidly adapt the law to new situations
- Provide for administration of the state
- Provide for public services that spontaneous order does not produce
