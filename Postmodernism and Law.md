# Postmodernism and Law

Defining postmodernism is difficult. 

__Modernism__: the idea that human knowledge is moving closer to objective truth.

__Postmodernism__: a response denying the possibility of objective truth and therefore progress towards it.  It substitutes objective with socially constructed truth.

Truth claims can only be true from a particular context, and this is the only possible sense of truth.

"there is nothing outside context" - Derrida

Structuralism is a response to existentialism and its undervaluing of how society & culture shape our choices.
