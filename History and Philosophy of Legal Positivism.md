# History and Philosophy of Legal Positivism

Readings 

- Ratnapala, _Jurisprudence_, 2009, Cambridge U P, Chapters 1 and 2
- Crowe, _Legal Theory_, 2009, Thomson Reuters, Chapter 3

Jurisprudence can refer to both: 

1) A specific body of law such as Roman Law or constitutional law
2) The philosophy of law, its nature & function

Jurisprudence (of the latter kind) can be divided into: 

- Normative Jurisprudence,
- Analytical Jurisprudence or _Legal Theory_, which can itself be divided into:
    - General Analytical Jurisprudence (the _concept_ of the law),
    - Particular Analytical Jurisprudence (_conceptions_ of the law)

## Legal Positivism

A doctrine of legal theory that seeks to explain the law _as it is_.  It traditionally held that law is created by law makers such as sovereigns, legislators, & judges, and argues for the separation of the law _as it is_ from how the law _ought to be_.

Legal positivism can be characterised by the following broad themes:

- Law is the creation of human agents
- Law can be identified by a set of formal criteria
- Law is social fact (the is/ought distinction of law)
- There is no _necessary_ connect between law and morality
- The descriptive/normative separation has distinct value

### History

While the idea of the sovereign's will as law has an ancient heritage, the first modern variant can be found in Jean Bodin's _Les Six Livres de la Republic_ (1576).  The Enlightenment and corresponding embrace of empiricism spawned a number of theory of laws including: 

- Legal Positivism (Hobbes & Bentham)
- Natural Right Theory (Grotius, Pufendorf, & Locke)
- Spontaneous Order Theories (Hume, Smith, & Ferguson) 

Under Hobbes' account, necessity forced people to embrace a social contract with an all powerful Sovereign, in order to avoid the brutishness of a state of nature.  As the _uncommanded commander_, the Sovereign's will was absolute.

Bentham rejected the idea that the Common Law was law because it lacked the signs of law and couldn't be known in advance.  He stipulated that law was:

- an assemblage of signs declarative of volition, 
- conceived of by a sovereign, 
- concerning conduct to be observed in certain cases,
- by persons or classes of persons,
- who are supposed to be under the sovereign's command.

## Austin's Command Theory of Law

John Austin published the seminal work of British legal positivism, _The Province of Jurisprudence Determined_, in 1832.  He developed and ontology of law based on the idea of authority:

- Laws properly so called (based on authority)
    - Laws set by humans to humans
        - Laws set by the Sovereign & deputies
        - Laws made by judges (on sovereign's authority)
        - Laws made by private persons pursuing legal rights
        - Laws made by private persons not pursuing legal rights
    - Laws set by God revealed in scripture
- Laws improperly so called (based on opinion)
    - Laws by metaphor (scientific laws)
    - Laws by analogy (customary, international law)
    
    Laws properly so called are positive laws (except those by private people not pursuing legal rights) while laws improperly so called are positive morality.
    
Command by the sovereign are law exhibit signs of:

- command
- desire
- duty
- sanction

Sovereigns can be identified if:

- the majority of the people obey
- it is continuous
- indivisible
- illimitable
- determinable
- human

### Implications of Austin's Account

Because law is decreed by a sovereign, law cannot exist prior to the sovereign. The indivisibility & illimitability requirements mean that international and constitutional law are positive morality rather than law, and common law is only law via delegation of sovereign authority to judges.

Unlike Bentham, Austin valued common law on instrumental grounds. Judges did a better job than legislators because the complexity of the world meant prescriptive commands were often ineffective.

The absolute power of the sovereign is a significant problem for Austin's account.  It means that even the British monarch isn't really sovereign as she is bound by constitution and tradition, neither are Federations and other pluralist power sharing arrangements, and large bodies of rules most people accept as law are ruled out.
