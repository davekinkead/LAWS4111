# H.L.A. Hart's Legal Positivism

Hart strongly criticised Command Theories of Law because they simply failed to reflect reality.  A key aim of the positivists was to identify law _as it is_ in a scientific manor in order to improve it.  This aim however, could not be released if their account of the law failed to reflect law _as it is_.

## Criticism of Command Theory

Law as a command doesn't yield the idea of a rule.  Law consists of action guiding rules and _ad hoc_ commands are not effective action guiders.

Hart noted rules have internal and external perspectives.  The external point of view describes what the law states.  The internal point of view concerns a subjects obligation to obey the rule.  Raz and MacCormick also identified a third detached point of view that a non subject may have.  Subjects to the law see themselves having obligations to obey but I (as a non subject) see no wrong in the action per se.

The idea of obligation is inseparable from the law.  Rules that generate obligations may form prior to any sovereign decree so Hart recognised customary law as law.  He also saw the command theory properly recognising: 

- tort law
- contract law
- procedure and evidentiary law
- constitutional law
- administrative law

## Hart's Unified Theory of Law

Hart thought that every society has rules, with correlative obligations to obey them.  When social pressure doesn't result in formal sanctions for disobedience, the rules make up morality.  When they do attract sanctions, they become primary legal rules.  Primary legal rules can arise from simple observance or command and are present even in primitive societies without written laws.  

Modern societies also exhibit rules concerning how the primary legal rules are created and altered.  These are secondary legal rules.  Secondary legal rules are characterised as _rules of recognition_.  They concern who, what, and how primary rules can be developed.

Hart posited that modern societies will have a single superior _rule of recognition_.  This rule of recognition may change by peaceful (referenda) or violent (revolution) means.

Public opinion plays and important secondary role in this account of law.  Not only does society shape primary laws, ie custom, the _rule of recognition_ requires sufficient obedience if it is to support the obligation to obey subsequent laws.

While Hart accepted that customary law was law, he rejected international law as law because it lacks secondary rules of recognition.
