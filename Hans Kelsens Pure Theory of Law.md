# Hans Kelsen's Pure Theory of Law

The Pure Theory of Law (PLW) sets out to specify what is the law.  It separates statements of facts from statements of legal norms.

Facts are the existing reality of a political system, ie QLD Parliament passed the Liquor Act in 1992.  Norms are the intent of authorities, ie high risk premises must not serve liquids in a glass container.

A command, prescription, or authorisation, is a law iff it is the subjective norm (ie the will) of the issuer validated by a prior objective norm.  The prior objective norm is itself a subjective norm grounded in an earlier objective norm.  The law exists solely in these norms.

The original, or _grundnorm_, is the grounding norm of a legal system. The legal normatively of this first law is simply 'presupposed' because and ought cannot be derived from an is, and presupposition of this norm is necessary to make the argument valid.

To be considered a legally valid, any norm (including the _grundnorm_) must belong to a system that is efficacious, ie generally followed by the relevant population. In short, a legal system must be both internally consistent and effective to be considered valid.

## Background

PLW is based upon Kant's idea of transcendental idealism, that we can only know from our senses _phenomena_ rather than reality _noumena_, and Hume's observations that an _ought_ can't be derived from an _is_.  As such, facts about how laws are created are separate, and cannot provide normative foundations to, laws which are _norms_.

> Norm is the meaning of an act by which a certain behaviour is commanded, permitted or authorised’ (1967, 5)

Norms can be both moral and legal.  A necessary condition of legal norms is that they are backed by coercive sanctions.

A legal norm is objectively valid if it complies with an antecedent legal norm.  The relation is not causal (because norms can't cause other norms) but rather prior norms _impute_ validity to later ones.

An objective legal norm consists the intersection of:

1. legislation, judicial precedent or custom – the facts about law
2. the legal norm – the results from the interpretation of the legislation, precedent or custom
3. the statement of the rule of law - the presupposition of the _grundnorm_.


## Grundnorm

The presupposition of the _grundnorm_ is only required if one wants the law to have normative force.  It is not something that is objectively necessary, but must be presumed if one wants consequent norms to have objective validity:

> The Pure Theory describes the positive law as an objectively valid order and states that this interpretation is possible only under the condition that a basic norm is presupposed…. The Pure Theory, thereby characterizes this interpretation as possible, not necessary, and presents the objective validity of positive law only as conditional—namely conditioned by the presupposed basic norm. (PT2, 217–218)

> An anarchist, for instance, who denied the validity of the hypothetical basic norm of positive law…. will view its positive regulation of human relationships… as mere power relations (GT, 413).
