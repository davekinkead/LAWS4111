# Feminist Legal Theories

## Defining Feminism

Feminism, or rather feminisms, are contested conceptions.  Any broad perspective might include two components however:

- (Equality thesis) A belief that women _should_ enjoy equal rights to men
- (Social thesis) A belief that this _is_ presently not the case 
- (Political commitment) therefore some degree of social change is needed to achieve this

A full account would also require a _feminist practice_ which requires political commitment to the ideal.

Objections to feminisms may attempt to reject it in two ways:

- reject the equality thesis - that women _are_ or _should_ be unequal
- reject the social thesis - that equality has already been achieved, 
- reject the political thesis - that action _should_ be taken

>  A theory is feminist to the extent it is persuaded that women have been unjustly unequal to men because of the social meaning of their  bodies.

## Schools of Feminism

A common dichotomy of feminism is radical and non-radical.  

Radical ...

Non-radical feminists are more likely to put gender discrimination on a similar level to other forms of social discrimination.  Non-Radical feminists who work within the existing legal paradigm are labelled _liberal feminists_.


## Models of Equality

Equality forms the locus of the normative ideal of feminism but it is also a contested idea.  Equality can be distinguished by three approaches: 

- _sameness_ - equality requires treating people identically
- _difference_ - equality requires different treatment based on different needs, valuing complementary roles equally
- _dominance_ - equality requires recognising existing dominance of men and pragmatically address the inequality of power

## Feminist Critiques

Is the practice assuming sex differences are objective when really socially constructed?  Does the practice run the risk of essentialism by ignoring the diversity of social groups?

Is the practice presenting a point of view as neural when it really represents a male perspective?  Is the practice assuming the status quo is natural and uncoerced when it really represents male values?

## Feminism and Law

Feminist legal theories focus on ways the law prevent women from enjoying gender equality.  They are a type of _critical legal theory_.  They posit: 

- the law _ought_ promote gender equality
- the law falls short of these aims
- the law entrenches gender inequality

Feminist issues differ from other legal issues in that they 

- address areas where _targeted action_ is needed to address gender inequality
- focus on areas that specifically or disproportionately impact women

Typically legal issues may include: 

- suffrage
- workplace participation (explicit, implicit, and structural restrictions)

## Sexual Assault

84% of reported sexual assaults are committed against women.  99% of offenders are male.  19% of Australian women over 15 have experienced sexual violence, and less than 5% of sexual assaults result in a criminal conviction.

Challenges to sexual assault prosecutions come from ยง24 of the Queensland Criminal Code that offers a defence on Mistake of Fact, where the appellant believes consent given when no specific objection is made.

## Pornography & Prostitution

While there is wide feminist agreement on issues of sexual assault, there is significant disagreement within feminist literature on the value of pornography.  Some argue that pornography allows the free expression of sexuality, while others posit that it exploits and degrades women.

The harm of pornography is claimed to come from:

- harm to subjects in the making of pornography
- harm of sexual assault and abuse informed/inspired by pornography
- harm of pornography's influence on social attitude
